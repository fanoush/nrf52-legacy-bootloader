# nrf52-legacy-bootloader

SDK11 Nordic legacy DFU OTA bootloader

### Getting started

This needs slightly patched Nordic SDK11, run get-sdk11.sh and hopefully it should be downloaded, extracted int oSDK11 folder and patched.

Then just type `make`, output is in `_build/nrf52832_xxaa_s132_<address>.hex`.
